## Running locally

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Contributing

Please ensure Husky's git hooks are enabled. Using `npm` this will be automated, but you can also do it manually:

```bash
npx husky install
```
